# AI Usage Statement

I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) to plan the structure, check accessibility details, and suggest JavaScript validation patterns. I edited and wrote the final HTML, CSS, and JavaScript myself, ensuring the code passes W3C validation and functions correctly. I only kept suggestions I fully understood and adapted.

I did not use drag-and-drop site builders. This submission represents my own skills and understanding.
